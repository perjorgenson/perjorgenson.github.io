I often catch myself staring at my plants. My head is mostly empty during these occasions, though sometimes a thought bubbles into my consciousness. Is it growing? Is it healthy? Maybe it&rsquo;s trying to wave a leaf at me, but the timescales that we live on are far too different.
Alas, the attention span of someone in their 20s in the Year Of Our Lord 2025 is three to four orders of magnitude shorter than needed to accomplish Plant-Human Understanding.

<p>The end result of this project is that I can relive the entire lifespan of one of my plants through a silent .mp4 file on my computer. Included topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>My first Cron Job</li>
<li>Making the end product reproducible with a decent <code>readme.md</code> file</li>
<li>Setting up a potentially reproducible virtual environment</li>
<li>MicroPython</li>
<li>Bash Scripts</li>
<li>Basic networking stuff</li>
<li>Not publishing my WiFi password to a public Git repo (2nd try)</li>
</ul>

<p>I originally bought a pack of three ESP32-CAM boards a few years ago when I was living in a sort of sketchy neighborhood. I would sometimes hear strange noises coming from the alleyway attached to my sliding-door glass entrance. The intent was to have a little DIY security camera, but I didn&rsquo;t have much hope of it surviving outside in the rain and wind for long. The nighttime intruders turned out to be possums and a large family of rats.</p>
